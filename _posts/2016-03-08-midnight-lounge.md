description: "\"With its (self) proclaimed 7-star rating and a nightly rate that ranges from a few thousand dollars to the immediate surrendering of your first born child, the Buri Al Arab is arguably the world's most luxurious hotel.\_With its sail-like features, the building instantly became\_an iconic representation of Dubai upon its completion in 1999. I find the night to be the most pleasant time to visit such landmark, capturing the night lights in perfect quietness.\""
